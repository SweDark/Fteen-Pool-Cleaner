My first decision was to use pascal case for variables and lower camel case for functions, as the task showed Lx and Ly as pascal cases (initial uppercase). 
I usually use pascal case for functions and lower camel case for variables.
Exceptions to this is the imports, promise (resolve, reject) and readline variable.

The second decision was to use console.log() instead of process.stdout.write().
The reason here is that console.log is just a formated process.stdout.write(), and I'm more used to using console.log().

The third decision is that the pool must be above 1 meter in length and width for the program to work since the machine can't move if the pool's size is 1x1.

The fourth decision was to stop the program anytime an error occurred. 
Since it didn't specify whenever the program should stop or ask the user to try again, I choose to stop it.

The fifth decision is about the cleaning path. 
Since it's a simulation of a machine that should have buttons, 
I choose to remove anything that isn't a command in the path validation instead of simply sending an error message and stopping the program.
